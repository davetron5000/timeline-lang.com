            Since time travel is inherently dangerous, the programming language we use must focus on safety, predictability, and comprehensibility. <span class="logomark">Timeline</span> is designed to make it as easy as possible to write software whose behavior we can both accurately predict and accurately explain.  It makes many tradeoffs in order to achieve this, all based on its core values.

                The runtime knows—and will enforce—the types of everything.  The literal values above are typed.  There is rarely a need for primitive/untyped vlues like raw integers.  The compiler understands that <code>37º20'12"3</code> is an <code>Angle</code> of 37 degrees, 20 hours, 12 minutes, and 3 seconds, and will construct the requisite data type.  Further, `destination` is a `Destination`, which is created by the values inside the brackets.  Lastly, large numeric values must have commas for readability.

                All variables must either be dictionary words, or be dictionary words joined with a dash.  To use an undefined word in a variable, that word must first be defined in the dictionary.  The result is that all variables are constructed of defined words.  Same goes for custom event names.
