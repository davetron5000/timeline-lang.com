        <h1 class="f3 tc">How does Time Travel Work?</h1>
<p class="lh-copy measure mh-auto">
          The theoretical basis for time travel was established by Drs Neil Bell and Chris Clarke, and you should consult their numerous papers on the subject if you wish to have a thorough analysis.  This page presents only a lay overview.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure mh-auto">
          First, to travel in time is to also travel in space.  The Earth rotates about the Sun, which rotates around the galactic center of the Milky Way galaxy.  The Milky Way is, of course, also in motion, inexorably moving away from the Big Bang.
</p>

<p class="lh-copy measure mh-auto">
          Therefore, we need to know not just <em>when</em> we are going, but <em>where</em>.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure mh-auto">
          A problem arises, however, when we consider the form of our travel.  Time travel, unfortunately, does not happen in an extra-dimensional reality. What actually  happens is that the machine driving our journey—the Time-Space Manifold—creates a vortex through space and time.  It helps to imagine this vortex as a tube, since this roughly matches its actual geometry.
</p>
        <figure class="tc">
          <img class="shadow-5 mw-100" src="/images/vortex__thumbnail.png" alt="Image of a tube, representing the vortex through which we travel through time">

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
<p class="lh-copy measure mh-auto">
          This vortex actually intersects with space.  Meaning: if there was an object in our path at any point in the past, we will run into that object.  However, unlike driving a car or flying a plane, where a human could react to obstacles, the journey through the vortex lasts only milliseconds.  So, imagine a journey that will only take 150ms, and 86ms into our journey, an object intersects our path:
</p>
        <figure class="tc">
          <img class="shadow-5 mw-100" src="/images/collision__thumbnail.png" alt="Image of the vortex with an object inside it, showing  how we&#x27;ll collide after 86ms of our journey">
          <figcaption>
            <a target="_new" class="link black f6 underline" href="/images/collision.png">Click to view full-size in new window</a>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
<p class="lh-copy measure mh-auto">
          This means that to avoid collision, we must route around this object.  For some objects whose position we know (such as the moon, or artificial satellites), we can pre-plan our trip to avoid them.  But space is filled with vast amounts of untracked objects.  There isn't enough time during the flight for a real person to avoid these objects.  Thus, we must create an automated flight plan that can react dynamically during the trip.
</p>
        <div class="measure mh-auto">
<pre class="bg-near-black light-green pa2 ba br3 b--light-green lh-copy overflow-x-scroll"><code>adjustment      is distance   - 2ms
adjustment-back is adjustment + 4ms
direction       is 360º       - position

send adjust vortex direction [
  direction:direction
] in adjustment

send adjust vortex direction [
  direction:direction
] in adjustment-back
</code></pre>
        </div>
<p class="lh-copy measure mh-auto">
          This is overly simplistic, but gives the basic idea.  A real flight plan will be much more involved.
