<p class="lh-copy measure mh-auto">
          <span class="logomark">Timeline</span> is an event-oriented language used to create <em>flight plans</em> for the <a class="link underline black" href="/time-space-manifold.html">Time-Space Manifold</a>, which allows travel through time and space.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure mh-auto">
          Each <span class="logomark">Timeline</span> program (flight plan) is written for a specific journey through time and space.  No flight plan is used more than once.  In fact, this is by design.  The creation of a general-purpose flight plan proved infeasible and it's easier and more reliable to hand-craft a flight plan for each journey.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure mh-auto">
          This reality shapes the design of <span class="logomark">Timeline</span>, which eschews abstraction, high level generic concepts, and many features found in general purpose programming languages.  <span class="logomark">Timeline</span> is designed with a focus on observability and predictability.  Language features must always be in service of making the flight plan easier to understand and predict.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure mh-auto">
          To aid in this endeavor, <span class="logomark">Timeline</span> includes a simulator, which runs a Monte Carlo simulation on the flight plan. The simulator includes a model of the known universe, along with a statistical model of areas of space to provide a good estimate of what matter and energy <em>not</em> on the galatic map might be there and disuprt the journey.  The output of the simluator is a risk analysis of the proposed flight plan.
</p>
        <h2 class="h3 tc">History</h2>
<p class="lh-copy measure mh-auto">
          After receiving a waiver against the 2048 Ban on Machine Learning Algorithms, Dr. Neil Clarke created a general-purpose pilot using an advanced neural network.  Despite early successes, a disasterous journey's failure could not be explained.  This was due to the inherent nature of machine learning algorithms and based on Dr. Clarke's inability to explain the failure, the waiver was rescinded and Dr. Clarke needed a new approach.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure mh-auto">
          Given that a general-purpose pilot was infeasible, Dr. Clarke instead began to program the Time-Space Manifold for a specific journey instead of a general-purpose one.  He initially did this in machine code.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure mh-auto">
          The first 23 journeys were a successful.  Journey 24, however, was a faiure, but the nature of the failure proved incredibly easy to explain (and thus correct for).  After 15 more journeys (2 of which <em>did</em> fail in easily explainable ways), the team agreed that a per-journey approach to programming the flight plan was the right way to go.
</p>
<p class="lh-copy measure mh-auto">
          Dr. Clarke's method of programming the Time-Space Manifold was to write down pseudo code and hand-translate it to machine code.  That pseudo code became the basis of <span class="logomark">Timeline</span>, and the language was created soon after.  Since it's first version, it has powered over 500 journeys through time.
